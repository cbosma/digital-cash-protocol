# Introduction #

**First e-Cash Protocol Meeting with Group (Matthew and Jonathan)**

# Details #

We are going to use the Java Programming Language with Eclipse and our editor.

The system allows money transaction between three parties: Customer, Merchant
and Bank.  Therefore we are planning on have 3 main classes for each type of transaction.

See the Projects List documents for more information on each type of transaction.
